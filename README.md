# -9N-Crypter-2.0-Public-Edition
This tool is truly legendary, especially as a free tool on GitHub. What it does is completely bypass Malwarebytes. Let me explain: when the tool encrypts, it embeds a virus file within it. It doesn't bypass Real-Time Protection; it only bypasses scans and VirusTotal, based on my experience.

Let's continue. The tool hides a file inside an .exe file. This file is your payload from any RAT, Stellar, or any type of malware. Of course, when you run the file, it runs the files inside it. The only file inside is the .exe or patch, depending on its format. It runs it and keeps it running. When someone scans their entire computer with Malwarebytes (which I consider a strong antivirus), the main file isn't deleted. What's deleted are the files saved in the %Temp% folder. The encrypted files are deleted by the scan, but the .exe file that runs them remains, hidden inside, completely normal.
